# Firecrawl Quickstarts

Firecrawl Quickstarts is a collection of projects designed to help developers quickly get started with building applications using the Firecrawl API. Each quickstart provides a foundation that you can easily build upon and customize for your specific needs.

## Getting Started

To use these quickstarts, you'll need a Firecrawl API key. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for free at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev).

## Available Quickstarts

### Firecrawl Web Crawling with OpenAI and Anthropic

This quickstart introduces how to integrate Firecrawl with OpenAI's Anthropic models to search and extract information based on specific user objectives. Learn to map a website, identify relevant pages, and retrieve content aligned with the objective. Ideal for targeted information gathering.

## General Usage

Each quickstart project is a Jupyter notebook designed to be easily opened and run on Google Colab. To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Repository in Google Colab**

   Each notebook has a link to open directly in Google Colab. Click on the link for the quickstart you want to explore.

2. **Set Up Your Firecrawl API Key**

   Each notebook requires a Firecrawl API key. Once you've created your key (available [here](https://firecrawl.dev)), enter it in the notebook when prompted or set it as an environment variable as directed in the notebook.

3. **Run Each Notebook Cell Sequentially**

   Follow the instructions within each notebook, running cells in order. The notebooks will guide you through each step, from setting up the environment to executing web scraping or extraction tasks.

4. **View Results and Experiment**

   The notebooks are designed to be interactive. You can modify the code cells, adjust parameters, or try different objectives to explore Firecrawl’s capabilities further.

Each notebook includes explanations and usage examples to help you understand and customize your setup.
