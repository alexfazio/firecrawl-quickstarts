**Definition of “AI Agents”**
An "AI Agent" is any system in which a large language model (LLM):
    1. Maintains Dynamic Control over how tasks are accomplished, including
       which tools or APIs are used and in what sequence.
    2. Plans, Reasons, and Adapts its approach based on user goals and
       feedback from its environment (e.g., tool outputs, code execution,
       external data).
    3. Acts Autonomously or Semi-Autonomously in open-ended or complex tasks
       that cannot be fully decomposed in advance.
    4. Demonstrates Decision-Making beyond hardcoded or strictly
       human-defined workflow paths, such as deciding what to do next at
       each step (versus executing a single, fixed script).

**Core Criterion for Classification**
A white paper belongs to the “AI Agents” category if its primary focus
describes, evaluates, measures, or demonstrates LLM-based systems that
exhibit or aim to exhibit one or more of the above qualities. This includes
systems that:
    • Show Partial, Incremental, or Full Autonomy in real-world or
      simulated tasks.
    • Employ LLMs to Dynamically Decide how to use tools (e.g., web
      browsing, code writing, system commands).
    • Investigate, Benchmark, or Compare the performance of such agentic
      systems, even if only a subset of tasks is completed autonomously.
    • Provide Frameworks for Building or Testing agentic capabilities in
      LLMs (e.g., multi-step planning, chain-of-thought reasoning,
      environment/tool usage).

**Clarifications to Prevent Underclassification**
    • Partial Autonomy Counts: Papers need not demonstrate 100% autonomous
      task completion. Even if an LLM handles only a fraction of tasks
      without human intervention, it can still qualify if the system’s
      goal or design involves adaptive or autonomous capabilities.
    • Research or Benchmarking is Included: Papers that focus on measuring,
      experimenting with, or benchmarking LLM agents should be classified
      as “AI Agents” if they revolve around agentic behavior, even if the
      research finds current systems are limited or only partially
      successful.
    • Use of Tools or Environment: If the paper describes LLMs selecting
      and executing code, commands, or API calls at their own discretion
      (i.e., not merely a single-step prompt for code generation), it
      likely falls under agentic systems.
    • Evaluation of Agent Performance: Studies that assess the
      effectiveness, reliability, or scalability of AI agents in performing
      tasks should be included if they address the agent’s ability to
      autonomously manage and execute tasks.
    • Integration with External Systems: Papers that explore how AI agents
      interact with external systems, databases, or APIs to accomplish
      tasks should be considered relevant.

**Exclusion Criterion**
A paper should not be classified under “AI Agents” if it only:
    • Discusses Static or Single-Step LLM Prompts that generate answers,
      translations, or content without autonomy or iterative
      decision-making.
    • Describes Purely Human-Orchestrated Pipelines where the LLM’s role is
      strictly predefined at each step (no dynamic path-finding, tool
      selection, or open-ended planning).
    • Focuses on General LLM Usage (e.g., chatbots, Q&A systems) without
      discussing autonomy, adaptive behavior, or iterative tool usage.

**Likely Categories for Agentic Systems Papers**
Based on Anthropic’s blog post, these arXiv categories are the most likely
homes for papers on agentic LLM systems:
    • Multiagent Systems (cs.MA) – Most directly relevant

    3. Acts Autonomously or Semi-Autonomously in open-ended or complex tasks
       that cannot be fully decomposed in advance.
    4. Demonstrates Decision-Making beyond hardcoded or strictly
       human-defined workflow paths, such as deciding what to do next at
       each step (versus executing a single, fixed script).

**Core Criterion for Classification**
A white paper belongs to the “AI Agents” category if its primary focus
describes, evaluates, measures, or demonstrates LLM-based systems that
exhibit or aim to exhibit one or more of the above qualities. This includes
systems that:
    • Show Partial, Incremental, or Full Autonomy in real-world or
      simulated tasks.
    • Employ LLMs to Dynamically Decide how to use tools (e.g., web
      browsing, code writing, system commands).
    • Investigate, Benchmark, or Compare the performance of such agentic
      systems, even if only a subset of tasks is completed autonomously.
    • Provide Frameworks for Building or Testing agentic capabilities in
      LLMs (e.g., multi-step planning, chain-of-thought reasoning,
      environment/tool usage).

**Clarifications to Prevent Underclassification**
    • Partial Autonomy Counts: Papers need not demonstrate 100% autonomous
      task completion. Even if an LLM handles only a fraction of tasks
      without human intervention, it can still qualify if the system’s
      goal or design involves adaptive or autonomous capabilities.
    • Research or Benchmarking is Included: Papers that focus on measuring,
      experimenting with, or benchmarking LLM agents should be classified
      as “AI Agents” if they revolve around agentic behavior, even if the
      research finds current systems are limited or only partially
      successful.
    • Use of Tools or Environment: If the paper describes LLMs selecting
      and executing code, commands, or API calls at their own discretion
      (i.e., not merely a single-step prompt for code generation), it
      likely falls under agentic systems.
    • Evaluation of Agent Performance: Studies that assess the
      effectiveness, reliability, or scalability of AI agents in performing
      tasks should be included if they address the agent’s ability to
      autonomously manage and execute tasks.
    • Integration with External Systems: Papers that explore how AI agents
      interact with external systems, databases, or APIs to accomplish
      tasks should be considered relevant.

**Exclusion Criterion**
A paper should not be classified under “AI Agents” if it only:
    • Discusses Static or Single-Step LLM Prompts that generate answers,
      translations, or content without autonomy or iterative
      decision-making.
    • Describes Purely Human-Orchestrated Pipelines where the LLM’s role is
      strictly predefined at each step (no dynamic path-finding, tool
      selection, or open-ended planning).
    • Focuses on General LLM Usage (e.g., chatbots, Q&A systems) without
      discussing autonomy, adaptive behavior, or iterative tool usage.

    • Partial Autonomy Counts: Papers need not demonstrate 100% autonomous
      task completion. Even if an LLM handles only a fraction of tasks
      without human intervention, it can still qualify if the system’s
      goal or design involves adaptive or autonomous capabilities.
    • Research or Benchmarking is Included: Papers that focus on measuring,
      experimenting with, or benchmarking LLM agents should be classified
      as “AI Agents” if they revolve around agentic behavior, even if the
      research finds current systems are limited or only partially
      successful.
    • Use of Tools or Environment: If the paper describes LLMs selecting
      and executing code, commands, or API calls at their own discretion
      (i.e., not merely a single-step prompt for code generation), it
      likely falls under agentic systems.
    • Evaluation of Agent Performance: Studies that assess the
      effectiveness, reliability, or scalability of AI agents in performing
      tasks should be included if they address the agent’s ability to
      autonomously manage and execute tasks.
    • Integration with External Systems: Papers that explore how AI agents
      interact with external systems, databases, or APIs to accomplish
      tasks should be considered relevant.

**Exclusion Criterion**
A paper should not be classified under “AI Agents” if it only:
    • Discusses Static or Single-Step LLM Prompts that generate answers,
      translations, or content without autonomy or iterative
      decision-making.
    • Describes Purely Human-Orchestrated Pipelines where the LLM’s role is
      strictly predefined at each step (no dynamic path-finding, tool
      selection, or open-ended planning).
    • Focuses on General LLM Usage (e.g., chatbots, Q&A systems) without
      discussing autonomy, adaptive behavior, or iterative tool usage.

**Likely Categories for Agentic Systems Papers**
Based on Anthropic’s blog post, these arXiv categories are the most likely
homes for papers on agentic LLM systems:
    • Multiagent Systems (cs.MA) – Most directly relevant

**Definition of “AI Agents”**
An "AI Agent" is any system in which a large language model (LLM):
    1. Maintains Dynamic Control over how tasks are accomplished, including
       which tools or APIs are used and in what sequence.
    2. Plans, Reasons, and Adapts its approach based on user goals and
       feedback from its environment (e.g., tool outputs, code execution,
       external data).
    3. Acts Autonomously or Semi-Autonomously in open-ended or complex tasks
       that cannot be fully decomposed in advance.
    4. Demonstrates Decision-Making beyond hardcoded or strictly
       human-defined workflow paths, such as deciding what to do next at
       each step (versus executing a single, fixed script).

**Core Criterion for Classification**
A white paper belongs to the “AI Agents” category if its primary focus
describes, evaluates, measures, or demonstrates LLM-based systems that
exhibit or aim to exhibit one or more of the above qualities. This includes
systems that:
    • Show Partial, Incremental, or Full Autonomy in real-world or
      simulated tasks.
    • Employ LLMs to Dynamically Decide how to use tools (e.g., web
      browsing, code writing, system commands).
    • Investigate, Benchmark, or Compare the performance of such agentic
      systems, even if only a subset of tasks is completed autonomously.
    • Provide Frameworks for Building or Testing agentic capabilities in
      LLMs (e.g., multi-step planning, chain-of-thought reasoning,
      environment/tool usage).

**Definition of “AI Agents”**
An "AI Agent" is any system in which a large language model (LLM):
    1. Maintains Dynamic Control over how tasks are accomplished, including
       which tools or APIs are used and in what sequence.
    2. Plans, Reasons, and Adapts its approach based on user goals and
       feedback from its environment (e.g., tool outputs, code execution,
       external data).
    3. Acts Autonomously or Semi-Autonomously in open-ended or complex tasks
       that cannot be fully decomposed in advance.
    4. Demonstrates Decision-Making beyond hardcoded or strictly
       human-defined workflow paths, such as deciding what to do next at
       each step (versus executing a single, fixed script).

**Core Criterion for Classification**
A white paper belongs to the “AI Agents” category if its primary focus
describes, evaluates, measures, or demonstrates LLM-based systems that
exhibit or aim to exhibit one or more of the above qualities. This includes
systems that:
    • Show Partial, Incremental, or Full Autonomy in real-world or
      simulated tasks.
    • Employ LLMs to Dynamically Decide how to use tools (e.g., web
      browsing, code writing, system commands).
    • Investigate, Benchmark, or Compare the performance of such agentic
      systems, even if only a subset of tasks is completed autonomously.
    • Provide Frameworks for Building or Testing agentic capabilities in
      LLMs (e.g., multi-step planning, chain-of-thought reasoning,
      environment/tool usage).

**Clarifications to Prevent Underclassification**
    • Partial Autonomy Counts: Papers need not demonstrate 100% autonomous
      task completion. Even if an LLM handles only a fraction of tasks
      without human intervention, it can still qualify if the system’s
      goal or design involves adaptive or autonomous capabilities.
    • Research or Benchmarking is Included: Papers that focus on measuring,
      experimenting with, or benchmarking LLM agents should be classified
      as “AI Agents” if they revolve around agentic behavior, even if the
      research finds current systems are limited or only partially
      successful.
    • Use of Tools or Environment: If the paper describes LLMs selecting
      and executing code, commands, or API calls at their own discretion
      (i.e., not merely a single-step prompt for code generation), it
      likely falls under agentic systems.
    • Evaluation of Agent Performance: Studies that assess the
      effectiveness, reliability, or scalability of AI agents in performing
      tasks should be included if they address the agent’s ability to
      autonomously manage and execute tasks.
    • Integration with External Systems: Papers that explore how AI agents
      interact with external systems, databases, or APIs to accomplish
      tasks should be considered relevant.

**Exclusion Criterion**
A paper should not be classified under “AI Agents” if it only:
    • Discusses Static or Single-Step LLM Prompts that generate answers,
      translations, or content without autonomy or iterative
      decision-making.
    • Describes Purely Human-Orchestrated Pipelines where the LLM’s role is

    1. Maintains Dynamic Control over how tasks are accomplished, including
       which tools or APIs are used and in what sequence.
    2. Plans, Reasons, and Adapts its approach based on user goals and
       feedback from its environment (e.g., tool outputs, code execution,
       external data).
    3. Acts Autonomously or Semi-Autonomously in open-ended or complex tasks
       that cannot be fully decomposed in advance.
    4. Demonstrates Decision-Making beyond hardcoded or strictly
       human-defined workflow paths, such as deciding what to do next at
       each step (versus executing a single, fixed script).

**Core Criterion for Classification**
A white paper belongs to the “AI Agents” category if its primary focus
describes, evaluates, measures, or demonstrates LLM-based systems that
exhibit or aim to exhibit one or more of the above qualities. This includes
systems that:
    • Show Partial, Incremental, or Full Autonomy in real-world or
      simulated tasks.
    • Employ LLMs to Dynamically Decide how to use tools (e.g., web
      browsing, code writing, system commands).
    • Investigate, Benchmark, or Compare the performance of such agentic
      systems, even if only a subset of tasks is completed autonomously.
    • Provide Frameworks for Building or Testing agentic capabilities in
      LLMs (e.g., multi-step planning, chain-of-thought reasoning,
      environment/tool usage).

**Clarifications to Prevent Underclassification**
    • Partial Autonomy Counts: Papers need not demonstrate 100% autonomous
      task completion. Even if an LLM handles only a fraction of tasks
      without human intervention, it can still qualify if the system’s
      goal or design involves adaptive or autonomous capabilities.
    • Research or Benchmarking is Included: Papers that focus on measuring,
      experimenting with, or benchmarking LLM agents should be classified
      as “AI Agents” if they revolve around agentic behavior, even if the
      research finds current systems are limited or only partially
      successful.
    • Use of Tools or Environment: If the paper describes LLMs selecting
      and executing code, commands, or API calls at their own discretion
      (i.e., not merely a single-step prompt for code generation), it
      likely falls under agentic systems.
    • Evaluation of Agent Performance: Studies that assess the
      effectiveness, reliability, or scalability of AI agents in performing
      tasks should be included if they address the agent’s ability to
      autonomously manage and execute tasks.
    • Integration with External Systems: Papers that explore how AI agents
      interact with external systems, databases, or APIs to accomplish
      tasks should be considered relevant.

**Exclusion Criterion**
A paper should not be classified under “AI Agents” if it only:
    • Discusses Static or Single-Step LLM Prompts that generate answers,
      translations, or content without autonomy or iterative
      decision-making.
    • Describes Purely Human-Orchestrated Pipelines where the LLM’s role is
      strictly predefined at each step (no dynamic path-finding, tool
      selection, or open-ended planning).
    • Focuses on General LLM Usage (e.g., chatbots, Q&A systems) without
      discussing autonomy, adaptive behavior, or iterative tool usage.

**Likely Categories for Agentic Systems Papers**
Based on Anthropic’s blog post, these arXiv categories are the most likely
homes for papers on agentic LLM systems:
    • Multiagent Systems (cs.MA) – Most directly relevant
    • Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
    • Computation and Language (cs.CL)
    • Machine Learning (cs.LG)
    • Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)

      browsing, code writing, system commands).
    • Investigate, Benchmark, or Compare the performance of such agentic
      systems, even if only a subset of tasks is completed autonomously.
    • Provide Frameworks for Building or Testing agentic capabilities in

**Clarifications to Prevent Underclassification**
    • Partial Autonomy Counts: Papers need not demonstrate 100% autonomous
      task completion. Even if an LLM handles only a fraction of tasks
      without human intervention, it can still qualify if the system’s
      goal or design involves adaptive or autonomous capabilities.
    • Research or Benchmarking is Included: Papers that focus on measuring,
      experimenting with, or benchmarking LLM agents should be classified
      as “AI Agents” if they revolve around agentic behavior, even if the
      research finds current systems are limited or only partially
      successful.
    • Use of Tools or Environment: If the paper describes LLMs selecting
      and executing code, commands, or API calls at their own discretion
      (i.e., not merely a single-step prompt for code generation), it
      likely falls under agentic systems.
    • Evaluation of Agent Performance: Studies that assess the
      effectiveness, reliability, or scalability of AI agents in performing
      tasks should be included if they address the agent’s ability to
      autonomously manage and execute tasks.
    • Integration with External Systems: Papers that explore how AI agents
      interact with external systems, databases, or APIs to accomplish
      tasks should be considered relevant.

**Exclusion Criterion**
A paper should not be classified under “AI Agents” if it only:
    • Discusses Static or Single-Step LLM Prompts that generate answers,
      translations, or content without autonomy or iterative
      decision-making.
    • Describes Purely Human-Orchestrated Pipelines where the LLM’s role is
      strictly predefined at each step (no dynamic path-finding, tool
      selection, or open-ended planning).
    • Focuses on General LLM Usage (e.g., chatbots, Q&A systems) without
      discussing autonomy, adaptive behavior, or iterative tool usage.

**Definition of “AI Agents”**
An "AI Agent" is any system in which a large language model (LLM):
    1. Maintains Dynamic Control over how tasks are accomplished, including
       which tools or APIs are used and in what sequence.
    2. Plans, Reasons, and Adapts its approach based on user goals and
       feedback from its environment (e.g., tool outputs, code execution,
       external data).
    3. Acts Autonomously or Semi-Autonomously in open-ended or complex tasks
       that cannot be fully decomposed in advance.
    4. Demonstrates Decision-Making beyond hardcoded or strictly
       human-defined workflow paths, such as deciding what to do next at
       each step (versus executing a single, fixed script).

**Core Criterion for Classification**
A white paper belongs to the “AI Agents” category if its primary focus
describes, evaluates, measures, or demonstrates LLM-based systems that
exhibit or aim to exhibit one or more of the above qualities. This includes
systems that:
    • Show Partial, Incremental, or Full Autonomy in real-world or
      simulated tasks.
    • Employ LLMs to Dynamically Decide how to use tools (e.g., web
      browsing, code writing, system commands).

      effectiveness, reliability, or scalability of AI agents in performing
      tasks should be included if they address the agent’s ability to
      autonomously manage and execute tasks.
    • Integration with External Systems: Papers that explore how AI agents
      interact with external systems, databases, or APIs to accomplish
      tasks should be considered relevant.

**Exclusion Criterion**
A paper should not be classified under “AI Agents” if it only:
    • Discusses Static or Single-Step LLM Prompts that generate answers,
      translations, or content without autonomy or iterative
      decision-making.
    • Describes Purely Human-Orchestrated Pipelines where the LLM’s role is
      strictly predefined at each step (no dynamic path-finding, tool
      selection, or open-ended planning).
    • Focuses on General LLM Usage (e.g., chatbots, Q&A systems) without
      discussing autonomy, adaptive behavior, or iterative tool usage.

**Likely Categories for Agentic Systems Papers**
Based on Anthropic’s blog post, these arXiv categories are the most likely
homes for papers on agentic LLM systems:
    • Multiagent Systems (cs.MA) – Most directly relevant
    • Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
    • Computation and Language (cs.CL)
    • Machine Learning (cs.LG)
    • Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)
    • Software Engineering (cs.SE)

**Definition of “AI Agents”**
An "AI Agent" is any system in which a large language model (LLM):
    1. Maintains Dynamic Control over how tasks are accomplished, including
       which tools or APIs are used and in what sequence.
    2. Plans, Reasons, and Adapts its approach based on user goals and
       feedback from its environment (e.g., tool outputs, code execution,
       external data).
    3. Acts Autonomously or Semi-Autonomously in open-ended or complex tasks
       that cannot be fully decomposed in advance.
    4. Demonstrates Decision-Making beyond hardcoded or strictly
       human-defined workflow paths, such as deciding what to do next at
       each step (versus executing a single, fixed script).

**Core Criterion for Classification**
A white paper belongs to the “AI Agents” category if its primary focus
describes, evaluates, measures, or demonstrates LLM-based systems that
exhibit or aim to exhibit one or more of the above qualities. This includes
systems that:
    • Show Partial, Incremental, or Full Autonomy in real-world or
      simulated tasks.
    • Employ LLMs to Dynamically Decide how to use tools (e.g., web
      browsing, code writing, system commands).
    • Investigate, Benchmark, or Compare the performance of such agentic
      systems, even if only a subset of tasks is completed autonomously.
    • Provide Frameworks for Building or Testing agentic capabilities in
      LLMs (e.g., multi-step planning, chain-of-thought reasoning,
      environment/tool usage).

**Clarifications to Prevent Underclassification**
    • Partial Autonomy Counts: Papers need not demonstrate 100% autonomous
      task completion. Even if an LLM handles only a fraction of tasks
      without human intervention, it can still qualify if the system’s
      goal or design involves adaptive or autonomous capabilities.
    • Research or Benchmarking is Included: Papers that focus on measuring,
      experimenting with, or benchmarking LLM agents should be classified
      as “AI Agents” if they revolve around agentic behavior, even if the
      research finds current systems are limited or only partially
      successful.
    • Use of Tools or Environment: If the paper describes LLMs selecting
      and executing code, commands, or API calls at their own discretion
      (i.e., not merely a single-step prompt for code generation), it
      likely falls under agentic systems.
    • Evaluation of Agent Performance: Studies that assess the
      effectiveness, reliability, or scalability of AI agents in performing
      tasks should be included if they address the agent’s ability to
      autonomously manage and execute tasks.
    • Integration with External Systems: Papers that explore how AI agents
